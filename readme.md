These have been my very first lines using JS-like syntax for production purposes in 2015. Now I'm little flushed about them, but they will stay here for the record.

# warehouse-prod-distributor-app

Controls the reception, movement,  and release of merchandise for a warehouse products distributor business. The user interface is implemented in Google Sheets and powered with Google App Scripts to move data from forms to the database, prepare printable receipts and to perform data analysis.
